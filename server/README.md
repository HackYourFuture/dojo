# Dojo server

Dojo backend server is built with express.js and typescript.

The backend root path is `/api`

## ⚙️ Setup
In the server root directory:
1. Run `npm run setup`
2. Configure the server in `.env`


## 📡 Start the server
To start the server, run the following command:
```
npm start
```

For local development of the backend, it is useful to run:
```
npm run dev
```
This command uses `nodemon` to re-run the server after every chance in the source file.
